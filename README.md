# cell-proliferation-longitudinal-study-
automatic system to measure the proliferation of cells (longitudinal study) in a 384 well plate.
we are interested in identifying whether the intrinsic kinetic (per capita growth rate "k") of cell proliferation is dependent on the initial cells number.
the idea is to seed (in a 384 well plate) initial different number of cells and follow the growth (in this case we compared 1,4 and 10 initial cells).
we used a programmable microscope incubator to take photo of the full area of each well (in the 384 well plate). the % of area occupied by cells have been estimated each day.
